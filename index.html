            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p class="mission-statement">To celebrate the personal breakthroughs that happen in our lives, both big and small, and the obstacles that held us back along the way, Breakthrough aims to connect friends and meet new ones, to recognize the supporters who helped us get where we are today, and to push us further tomorrow</p>
            <p class="mission-description">Breakthrough started with a wish to celebrate in a different way. Most celebrations like birthdays, Christmas, or New Year's are based around traditions and have very little to do with anything you personally did or the everyday problems that make up our lives. In contrast, Breakthrough highlights all the small victories and celebrates those things through a yearly event of inspiration, bonding, personal development, and fun.</p>
